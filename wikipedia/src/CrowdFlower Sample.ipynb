    "### Summary\n",
    "There is no great way to determine bots. Here are 3 strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `recentchnages` table contains 30 days of data and tells you which revisions where made by bots. This is the most reliable data, but there may be a seasonal trend in harassment that biases the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check if the user is in the bot group in the `user group` table. Drawbacks are:\n",
    "    - Group membership can change over time. There are many bot-flagged edits by users that are no longer in a user group providing the bot right. Likewise there are many edits not bot-flagged by users that now have the bot right (which they may or may not use for each edit).\n",
    "    - Not all bots are a member of this group (there are other groups that provide this right, sysop, for example).\n",
    "3. Remove users with 'bot|Bot|BOT' in the user_name. Almost all bots in the 'bot' user group fit this pattern, but there will be many false positives. It seems unlikely that these false positives result in biased sample ...\n",
    "\n",
    "For now I will go with option 3."
