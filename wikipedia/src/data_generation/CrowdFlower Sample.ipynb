If you want the correct information you cannot rely on what Orlady has told you. She is the sole individual objecting to the use of the term 'mural' when referring to the artwork that is in the building. The building is a NRHP however not so much for the architectural significance, but for the murals inside. Specific reference to the term 'mural' can be seen in a number of sources that were provided.  These sources include very reliable documents including: [http://www.nr.nps.gov/multiples/64000597.pdf United States Post Offices in New York -- 1858 to 1943 -- Thematic Resources] (the National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form), [http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:IAGKYiwfmcEJ:www.westchestergov.co/pdfs/NRO_06-009_Lecount_Sq_DEIS_FINAL.pdf+Post+Office+New+Rochelle+murals&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=12&amp;gl=us The Westchester County Planning Board discussing the post office in relation to re-developing the site],[http://www.dec.ny.gov/enb2006/20060524/not3.html further discussions],  and [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30615FF3F5C14738DDDAC0994D9405B898FF1D3 the New York Times article about the artist selected to paint the murals]. The nomination form is the most irrefutable source validating the information (it specifically references two of the three murals when discussing the importance of post office art). Additionally, the city of New Rochelle continues with redevelopment of the area and has recently come to the decision that the significance of the building itself is minimal, with its only true attribute being the 'distinctive curved contour' of the front facade which is familiar to residents of the area and should be maintained. (Im sorry but I cant find this specific document at the moment). The continuing reverting of this information is entirely the result of Orlady who personally does not seem to care for the facts. Unfortunately it is resulting in a deficient and inaccurate article. I also should mention that blocking users as alleged puppets of a banned user seems to be the most useful means for Orlady to control the content of certain articles. She is clearly abusing the tool. The validity of her claims is questionable at best. I was blocked as a result of my contributions to this article, and was labeled a 'sock'.

Please do not make another reply to this talk page. I have repeatedly proven my points, but the fact that you choose not to listen proves that this conversation is going nowhere. I am in the process of gaining administrative help in not only preventing the both of you from harassing me like this, but also in overturning your ridiculous, biased \"\"sockpuppet investigation\"\". Have a good life. (  )\"\n",

      "*Daedalus969, it has come to my attention that the sockpuppet investigation proposal was '''[[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/SPI/Subpage_-_Declined_cases|denied]]'''. Thus, you and Landon1980 have absolutely no ground to continue editing the page, especially by adding false statements, as you did [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ASockpuppet_investigations%2FIbaranoff24&diff=264945773&oldid=264830350 here].

      "NEWLINENEWLINE* Are you kidding me? I never engaged in sockuppetry, edit warring, harassment or email abuse. I am being harassed myself. Just look at the edits of Daedalus969 and Landon1980. They repeatedly lied about my edits and prevented any attempt by anyone else at making a valid edit that disagreed with their personal opinions. You are reaching far beyond your ground. I have been a respected member of Wikipedia for four years. I have six featured articles, countless good articles, and I have been asked to be nominated for adminship '''TWICE'''. This clearly proves that these allegations are outrageously false. You have overstepped your bounds by taking the side of my harassers.
