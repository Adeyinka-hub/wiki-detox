I have been blocked for no good reason by the above admins. I was shocked because I am a novice. But after looking around, Ive realized that the shocking part is that public does not know what goes on behind the scenes here at Wikipedia. I shall strive to educate my friends about this horrendous jungle. What a shame. I congratulate ragib and InShaneee on their power. Enjoy. I can imagine what you had to do to become admins. You truly belong there. Perhaps you should consider a career in politics...maybe you already have.\n",
