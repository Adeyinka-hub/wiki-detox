Both Hitler and Mussolini admired the left-wing state intervention Roosevelt had enacted while in office and enacted similar policies themselves, while in office.

The conclusion is that the article remains.  Another editor has already contested the PROD, and I can see that your previous attempt at deletion through AfD failed.  Instead, you can help the community by undoing vandalism to this (and other) articles whenever you encounter it.  Cheers,   \"\n",
