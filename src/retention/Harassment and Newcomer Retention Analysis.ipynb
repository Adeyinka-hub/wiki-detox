    "In this notebook we investigate how receiving harassment correlates with newcomer activity and retention. For the purposes of this study, our measures of harassment are classifiers over individual discussion comments for personal attacks, aggression and toxicity. These classifiers were developed [in previous work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08914). We will investigate the relationship between harassment and newcomer retention through running regression models that use a measures of editing activity and harassment in time span t1 as independent variables and a measure of harassment in time span t2 as the dependent variable."

    "Gender in Wikiedia is not well defined. After registering, users have the ability to report their gender in their user preferences. The vast majority of users do not report their gender. This may be because reporting their gender is not important to them, they don't want to report a gender, or they simply are unaware of the feature. There is anectodital evidence that users often report an incorrect gender. Overall, this means that we should expect users who report their gender to be different than the rest and we cannot be sure if reported genders are correct. Another caveat for the following analysis is that we do not know when the user reported their gender; they may have changed their user preference after our 2 month interval of interest.\n",
